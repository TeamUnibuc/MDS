Currently, there is functionality for getting all bots, adding a new bot, and deleting a bot from the database.

## GET all bots
```typescript
await api.bots.getBots()
/*
json of the form
[{
 _id,
    id,
    userId,
    gameId,
    code
}, obj2, ..]
*/
```

## POST a new bot
```ts
await api.bots.addBot(obj)
/*
obj should be of the form
{
    id, userId, gameId, code
}
*/
```

## DELETE an existing bot
```ts
await api.bots.deleteBot(id)
/*
Currently using the id generated by mongodb
pass it as a string and initialise it on the backend as an ObjectID, and then pass it to the mongodb delete function
*/
const OId = new mongodb.ObjectID(id)
```

## CRUD TO DO
1. Add update functionality
1. Make respective forms for creating and editing entities in separate VueJs components
1. Add this functionality for the rest of the entities (users, games)
1. Discuss how these entities should look like, what should they contain (add lib component to a game), how should they be linked (based on what property, our own ids, or use the mongodb generated ids)
1. Refactor code

## API TO DO
1. Check out zerorpc
1. Have a functionality of picking a game, bots, ask the backend to play them (write a script for this) and return the result to the frontend
1. Add images/components to indicate when waiting for information from backend (mini loading screens)
